And you can actually see bits of the old plot in the movie. Like you can see Nick's warehouse for his amusement park called \""Wilde times\"" when Judy was calling herself a dumb bunny. And there's actually old storyboards up on here youtube where they show the taming collars that predators had to wear to may prey trust them and feel safe. And you can find a taming collar party set of storyboards where this polar bear cub gets his taming collar and becomes a big bear. And the taming collars are shock collars that shock the predators when they get a little too emotional. So as in when they excited, angry and among other emotional emotions they will get shocked. And the polar bear cub gets shocked after being all happy after the taming collar gets put on him. And it's just really sad. And he runs back and hugs his dad. I cried crazily when I first found that scene. But ummm.. one of the original plots was gonna have Nick wilde as the main character and have Judy as the secondary main character. Nick has this idea to make this amusement park where predators can be themselves and take their collars off and not hurt anybody after his own collar gets taken off when he hurts his neck. I'm not gonna go full into the original plot but yeah if Zootopia used that plot it would have been wayyy darker and scary. And it would ended on a bittersweet note which sadly disney can't do cuz they need happy ending. But I happy they got to keep so of the darker plot elements in the official release.

And obvi i\u2019m white so I\u2019m not trying to speak over black woman, just trying to add perspective as a different minority. Also, as both a minority and an ally, I\u2019d definitely suggest you don\u2019t overthink things. Cis/straight/white people can have great takes that their minority counterparts either haven\u2019t fully articulated yet because to them it\u2019s just an obvious fact of life, or have articulated and nobody listened, and unfortunately, sometimes it just takes a white/cis/straight/male person to get other people to listen. That said, a lot of this kind of media analysis has probably been done by that minority group already, and they\u2019re probably a lot smaller than you, so if you can find it, it\u2019s always great imo to uplift small minority channels and writers. So don\u2019t overthink things, because as long as you give it a good, honest effort (especially if you read books! If you read just like 1 or 2 books in a subject you\u2019ll already be more of an ally than 90% of people are), you give a genuine effort to be in community and establish real relationships with minorities, and you treat us like people fully and not dehumanize us, I promise you are doing much better than you think. And also, most minorities you\u2019ll meet wont know the intimacies of theory, only their actual lived experiences, so just listen, and don\u2019t quote literature at them like you know more than them from reading a single book, even when you are \u201cright\u201d. Just listen and be a good person and be chill and I promise you you\u2019re a great ally. It\u2019s ok to do the best you can, because that\u2019s all that you can do.

"{""cid"": ""UgymuEPfYtblB2_zPcx4AaABAg"", ""text"": ""21:00 I absolutely agree. Modern Disney has totally abandoned actual storytelling (which requires a problem/want, an action taken in response to that problem/want, and consequences that follow based on those). I'm an animator so my best guess is that suits come into a project and they want to change one scene, then later they want to change another scene, etc. but by the end of the movie it's like they've poked so many holes in the foundation that the house doesn't stand anymore and the plot no longer makes sense or has any motivation/clear line to follow. It's really depressing. There's a definite lack of consideration for the \""but why?\"" in modern Disney. For example in Wish Magnifico doesn't grant everyone's wishes. But why? Does it drain his power? Does it make them more pliable and easier to control as a population? Does holding their wishes give him power to reshape the wishes? Asha is mad that Magnifico doesn't grant all the wishes. But why? Aren't there people with dangerous or conflicting wishes? Would it be a good thing to grant them all? Modern Disney is riddled with stuff like this where it seems like they want a certain archetype or vignette, but they don't bother to think through (or at least show) the ramifications, lead-up, justifications, or results of that thing. It kind of reminds me of first-time DnD players who don't know how their character would react to things (because they haven't thought through the how/why their character got to the present)."", ""time"": ""1 month ago (edited)"", ""author"": ""@uninvincibleete"", ""channel"": ""UC1QCfrKDUsB75OncKgx0HGA"", ""votes"": ""1"", ""replies"": ""1"", ""photo"": ""https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_luHNJqXbvXyHfTEbVWPgXAx-bqxNx5OlyKFnr2Wbg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj"", ""heart"": false, ""reply"": false, ""time_parsed"": 1762768660.969285}"

"{""cid"": ""UgzSocEhwVo55sqVZJJ4AaABAg"", ""text"": ""16:22 yeah this is true. I think as you point out as a metaphor it still works. But I also think a few other things are worth pointing out.\n\nmainly that predation, for most predators, is incredibly dangerous. Prey are risky to kill without getting mortally wounded in a world where there isn\u2019t law enforcement protecting them, or social stigma dissuading the action in the first place. As long as the animals are evolved, and value staying alive over whatever instincts would cause them to consider predation, this is a non-issue, and betrays that the actual fear isn\u2019t the predatory instinct, its the notion that the predators aren\u2019t evolved enough for society, Wich is much closer to a textbook racist defense. \n\nAnother thing that I think the movie does very intentionally is have the animals \u2018go savage\u2019. Because while it is absolutely understandable about a prey animal being more concerned over a predator\u2019s ability to kill them (without weapons) than a prey animal, but the problem is not a series of murderers where the murderers were all of sound mind. The problem is not predators choosing to do bad things because they are predators, and predators are predisposed to making bad choices, because they are naturally more evil. It\u2019s obvious that they are loosing their \u2018evolution\u2019 and it\u2019s also obvious, at least to me, that a prey animal also could. In this case they were directly being poisoned, but we can acknowledge Yes, it\u2019s entirely plausible that the reason lay in biology or customs. But not because they are lesser, but because they are different. \n\nI think this movie could have been a weaker narrative but a better metaphor if the problem turned out to be some kind of chemical (maybe preservative) that was added to a niche brand of imitation meat. It breaks down into a toxin inside the body if you have a certain type of enzyme- an enzyme that very very few prey species have and most predators do(or vice versa if you don\u2019t have the enzyme). The chemical had been tested a while ago (maybe before the mamal inclusion initiative updated safety testing standards) and deemed safe(prey outnumber preds 10/1), but mostly used in prey foods. Only recently did this particular product add it, without additional testing. \nI think that kind of resolution is much too dense and maybe a bit too dark for what Disney wanted, but it\u2019s a lot closer to things that happen in real life. Like how so many safety/health tests aren\u2019t done considering women(heart attack symptoms, nearly all drugs, especially thalidomide, car crashes) how some people are simply lactose intolerant, or have celiac disease. Celiac especially can cause you to go pretty insane if you eat a lot of stuff you shouldn\u2019t. Things like prions also make you crazy, but only by eating from another animal (brains) so we absolutely could have anchored the metaphor better or more clearly, but it definitely wouldn\u2019t have made for as good an ending for the movie\u2019s target audience."", ""time"": ""1 month ago"", ""author"": ""@serpentmaster1323"", ""channel"": ""UCB_EJp7mO6UZQlxvAKW5YMQ"", ""votes"": ""2"", ""replies"": """", ""photo"": ""https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_laWnpN1aTjiCGrozYGpAct4_lLelHxvjDOUYBfjCs=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj"", ""heart"": false, ""reply"": false, ""time_parsed"": 1762768717.90336}"

"{""cid"": ""UgzdQO1u3xOylbg_2cd4AaABAg"", ""text"": ""16:00 You're right Alex, these aren't the best representations of racism because they're technically based on (in movie) truths rather than untruths told to deny equality and justify systemic racism. Though the predator allegory works a little better because so much of early systemic racism was trying to justify it with science. Black people were studied to figure out if they were naturally stupid, slow, simple, etc... (spoiler alert, they're not). It still affects science and racism today. \n\nAnd when DNA testing became a widepread in labs there was a whole wave of science that tried to determine if there were biological causes for violent crime or delinquency in people's DNA, which fits well here - as in looking for a biological explanation rather than a social or external reason for things that are happening and have a history of happening (crime in predominantly colored and poor neighborhoods and predators becoming savage) but are in fact caused by systematic racism or in this case caused by biological espionage (also not the best fit for representing actual racism). \n\nSo zootopia does some things a little better but it does still miss the mark. I think the best thing it does is encourage people to be curious about why people might be upset or angry or do bad things and consider what's happening to that person rather than making assumptions that it's \""just how they are\"", as well as question racialized stereotypes.\n\nI hope that makes sense. I'm have a bachelor's in anthropology and I'm in graduate school for American Studies fyi.\n\nBellweathers rant is actually a good representation of how systemic racism uses fear and moral superiority to increase racial and class divides. Though in our case it's the system doing it, not one radical sheep.
