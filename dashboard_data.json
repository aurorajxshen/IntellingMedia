He has the permits, he didn\u2019t lie, and he only had to pose as a father-son duo because of the racism directed towards foxes. \n\nI always thought that this stuff was actually illegal since the movie just moves past it, but geez, he seriously didn\u2019t do anything wrong\n\nEdit: Ok, minus the tax evasion, but honestly? That\u2019s just from the movie needing a reason for Nick to work with Judie.",
